## about
This site is my personal resume/portfolio website. It comes in two shapes: one is personalized and directed at a specific visitor (by providing a GUID-id in the url), the other is the default version, which is generic and directed at any visitor.

In practice, this means that a specific visitor, when given a personalized url, will be welcomed with a personalized message at the landing page, as well as a cover letter written specifically for them. 


## technical info

In the creating of this webapp a combination of modern frameworks/techniques was used: Vue (3+), Hygraph (GraphQL headless CMS), Firebase (for hosting) and Tailwind (CSS utility-first framework). See my repository 'blog-template' for a more detailed/technical explanation of the usage of these techniques and design patterns (this repository is forked and modded from 'blog-template').
